javascript object vs json

 
1->json is a string format and js object is an object
2-> We can also send array in json format
3->undefined,function can not be sent into json 


json.stringify is use to translate your js object/data into jsonstring making it suitbale for travelling through mediums  and after that express.json is used to convert the json strinf data into its original form
